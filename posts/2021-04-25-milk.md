this is a milk appreciation post.

today i learned about the existance of [milk paint](https://www.realmilkpaint.com/category/colors/), which seems like a lovely substance. the thought of hand-mixing powdered pigment with water is appealing.

p.s. the only human who loves milk more than i do is british comedian mike wozniak.
