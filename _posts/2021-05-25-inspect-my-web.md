today i learned that the develop menu is not turned on by default in safari. that's kind of too bad. there are probably some people who would accidentally start exploring web development by stumbling across that menu during a rogue browsing session. oh well.

also, the panel that shows you the console, html & css, network data and other details is called the web inspector.
