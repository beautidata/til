have you ever been in the situation where you need to test your code, but it depends on a different piece of code that your friend is working on? and they haven't deployed it yet, so you can't fully test your code right now? annoying right?

well, luckily the folks over at [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) built a tool that allows you to share a public url that points to your local environment. i used it for the first time today and it was pretty neat! very convenient. i am grateful this tool exists.
